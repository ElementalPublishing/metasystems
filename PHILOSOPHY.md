# Project Philosophy

A “system” is more than just a collection of parts.

## What Makes a System?

- **Interconnection:**  
  The parts of a system interact and depend on each other. Relationships and interactions are as important as the parts themselves.

- **Emergence:**  
  The system as a whole exhibits behaviors or properties that cannot be predicted just by looking at the individual parts.  
  “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”

- **Purpose or Function:**  
  A system has a **main purpose** or goal that arises from the organization and interaction of its parts.

 For example, A computer’s **main purpose** is to **process information and run programs** (software). This means:

- Taking input (data, commands)
- Performing calculations, logic, or transformations on that data
- Storing, retrieving, and managing information
- Producing output (results, actions, communication)
- Running a wide variety of programs to automate tasks, solve problems, and enable user interaction

All of its hardware and software components are organized and interconnected to achieve this central purpose.

- **Boundaries:**  
  A system has boundaries that distinguish it from its environment, but it can interact with its environment through inputs and outputs.

- **Feedback:**  
  Systems often have feedback loops, where the output of the system influences its own input. Feedback can stabilize or destabilize the system.

- **Organization:**  
  The arrangement and structure of the parts matter. How parts are organized determines how the system behaves.

## Summary Table

| Just a Collection of Parts | System (in Systems Theory)           |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Parts are independent     | Parts are interconnected             |
| No emergent behavior      | Emergent properties/behaviors        |
| No shared purpose         | Has a purpose/function               |
| No boundaries             | Has boundaries with environment      |
| No feedback               | Feedback loops present               |
| No organization           | Organized structure matters          |
