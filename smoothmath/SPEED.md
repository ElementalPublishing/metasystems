*Lower time is better. Speedup >1 means smoothmath is faster.*

Your SPEED.md results provide a **clear, data-driven story** about the strengths and tradeoffs of your smoothmath module compared to NumPy for a wide range of Blender/game array sizes and use cases.

---

## **What the Results Tell Us**

### **1. smoothmath is Extremely Fast for Small Arrays**
- For edge cases, animation curves, color ramps, and LUTs (sizes 1–128), smoothmath is **2x–20x faster** than NumPy.
- This is a huge win for real-time animation, procedural curves, and any logic that operates on small batches.

### **2. smoothmath is Consistently Faster for Smootherstep and Large Arrays**
- For **smootherstep** (the quintic version), smoothmath is faster than NumPy for almost every size, especially as arrays get larger.
- For **large and very large arrays** (particle systems, images, simulation grids), smoothmath is **1.1x–2x faster** for most functions.

### **3. NumPy Still Wins for Some Medium-Sized and Certain Functions**
- For **medium-sized arrays** (e.g., 1,024–100,000) and the classic cubic `smoothstep`, NumPy sometimes outperforms smoothmath by a factor of 1.2–5x.
- This is likely due to NumPy’s highly optimized C vectorization for simple polynomials.

### **4. For Real-World Blender Use Cases**
- Most real-world Blender/game data falls into the **small, medium, and large** array categories.
- For **procedural animation, color ramps, and custom attribute layers**, smoothmath is a clear winner.
- For **very large simulation or image data**, smoothmath is also highly competitive or better.

## **What Should You Focus On?**

### **1. Target Use Cases Where smoothmath Excels**
- **Procedural animation, color ramps, LUTs, and custom attribute layers** (small arrays, high call frequency)
- **Smootherstep and generalized smoothstep** (where NumPy is slower or not available)
- **Large-scale batch processing** (particle systems, simulation grids, high-poly meshes)

### **2. Consider Optimizing Classic smoothstep for Medium Arrays**
- If you want to close the gap with NumPy for classic smoothstep on medium arrays, profile and optimize your Cython code for this specific case (e.g., loop unrolling, SIMD, or memory access patterns).

### **3. Provide a Unified, Easy-to-Use API**
- Offer both **scalar** and **vectorized** (array) versions.
- Make it easy to switch between smoothmath and NumPy for users who want maximum flexibility.

---

## **What Kind of Module Should You Build?**

- **A high-performance, robust math module for Blender/game/procedural graphics developers.**
- Focus on **animation, procedural shading, geometry nodes, and simulation**.
- Provide **fast, vectorized implementations** of smoothstep, smootherstep, and generalized smoothstep.
- Include **derivatives, inverses, and utility functions** for animation and procedural workflows.
- Offer **easy integration** with both Python lists/arrays and NumPy arrays (for interoperability).
- Document **where smoothmath is faster** and recommend it for those use cases.

## **Summary Table**

| Use Case                        | smoothmath vs NumPy | Recommendation                |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Animation curves, LUTs, ramps    | Much faster        | Use smoothmath                |
| Smootherstep, generalized step   | Much faster        | Use smoothmath                |
| Large arrays (meshes, particles) | Faster or equal    | Use smoothmath                |
| Classic smoothstep, medium array | NumPy faster       | Use NumPy or optimize further |

---

## **Summary**

- **Better for animation, procedural, and Blender/game math.**
- **Faster for small/large arrays and advanced interpolation.**
- **Considering a hybrid API**: use smoothmath by default, but allow fallback to NumPy for classic smoothstep on medium arrays if absolute peak performance is needed.
